## 📖 What I am currently learning / improving on

- I am currently researching on transformer architectures, particularly how they can be used in NLP and beyond.
- I am exploring federated learning, a new decentralized approach to training machine learning models.
- Improving my skills in reinforcement learning to create intelligent agents that can learn from their own experiences.
- Studying the application of AI in Quantum Computing.

## 💻 Some of my projects

- **Project1**: An end-to-end deep learning model for pattern recognition in large datasets using Convolutional Neural Networks. [Code](https://github.com/YourGithubUserName/Project1)
- **Project2**: An AI-based predictive model for stock market trends using LSTM and time series data. [Code](https://github.com/YourGithubUserName/Project2)
- **Project3**: A chatbot powered by transformer-based models and open-source NLP tools like Hugging
